 * The parity of a sequence of bits is 1 if the number of 1s in the sequence is
 * odd; otherwise, it is 0. Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors
 * in data storage and communication. It is fairly straightforward to write code
 * that computes the parity of a single 64-bit nonnegative integer.
 * 
 * Problem 5.1: How would you go about computing the parity of a very large
 * number of 64-bit nonnegative integers?
