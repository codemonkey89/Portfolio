/**
 * Reconstruct Binary Tree With Levelorder And Inorder
 * Hard
 * Recursion
 * 
 * Given the levelorder and inorder traversal sequence of a binary tree,
 * reconstruct the original tree.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * The given sequences are not null and they have the same length
 * There are no duplicate keys in the binary tree
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * levelorder traversal = {5, 3, 8, 1, 4, 11}
 * 
 * inorder traversal = {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11}
 * 
 * the corresponding binary tree is
 * 
 * 5
 * 
 * / \
 * 
 * 3 8
 * 
 * / \ \
 * 
 * 1 4 11
 * 
 * How is the binary tree represented?
 * 
 * We use the pre order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting
 * the null node.
 * 
 * For Example:
 * 
 * The sequence [1, 2, #, 3, 4, #, #, #] represents the following binary tree:
 * 
 * 1
 * 
 * / \
 * 
 * 2 3
 * 
 * /
 * 
 * 4
